## why me?
> why not you?
this bot is one of the most incredible bootstraps you can have, with fully fledged message commands, interaction commands (yep, both mediums are supported), and a fully fledged event handler. it's also very easy to use, and you can easily add your own commands and events.
also, there's a cool database system (json woaah) that you can use to store data in a file, and it's very easy to use.
plus it's made by thunderredstar so it's obviously the best bot ever made
